# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Overview
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer using multiple machine learning models. The primary goal was to evaluate and compare different classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy in identifying cancerous cases.

# Models Used
The following models were implemented and tested:
Logistic Regression


Neural Network


Support Vector Machine (SVM)


K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with k-values: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9


# Results
After extensive experimentation, the highest accuracy achieved was 98%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the selected models in breast cancer classification.

# Conclusion
The study highlights the potential of machine learning in medical diagnosis, showcasing how different classifiers perform in detecting breast cancer. Future improvements may include hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and experimenting with deep learning models to further enhance performance.
